# Visualizing 2015-2018 Teen Birth Rate Trends in Baltimore City

# Problem
According to the [Baltimore City Health Department](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/170), Baltimore City has an average teen birth rate of 43.4 out of 1,000 teenage females (ages 15-19). This rate is about twice as high as the national average (26.5 out of 1,000). Although this rate has been steadily declining over the past decade, there is more that can and should be done.

Teen birth is a serious social and economic problem. [According to one study](https://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/child_trends-2010_01_22_FS_diplomaattainment.pdf), teen pregnancies and births are a significant contributor to dropping out of school. Females who dropout of school face social stigma, fewer job opportunities, lower salaries, and a [higher probability of criminal activity](https://www.doe.mass.edu/dropout/overview.html?section=consequences#:~:text=Dropping%20out%20of%20school%20has,with%20the%20criminal%20justice%20system). There is also a social ripple effect. Like their mothers, [children of teen births](http://webarchive.urban.org/publications/901199.html#:~:text=Teenage%20motherhood%20costs%20taxpayers%20about,teenage%20parents%20and%20their%20children) are more likely to achieve lower education, be incarcerated, experience teen pregnancy, and have difficulty finding employment. Due to the socioeconomic status of their teen mother, they are also more likely to have health problems.
